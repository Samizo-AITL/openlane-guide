# openlane-guide

> Read this repository and stop breaking your OpenLane environment forever.

This repository is a **battle-tested, failure-driven guide** for running OpenLane  
in a **stable, reproducible, and disaster-proof** way.

This is **not** a quick start.  
This is **not** a feature reference.

This repository exists because **real environments were broken**.

## 📦 What this repository is

This repository documents the **entire OpenLane reality**, including:

- 🐧 WSL2 + Docker environment survival
- 🧊 OpenLane1 vs OpenLane2 coexistence (strict separation)
- 🧬 PDK asset management (sky130 / gf180)
- 🧱 Full physical design flow
- 📐 Placement / CTS / Routing
- 📊 DRC / LVS / STA
- 📦 GDS signoff
- 🔍 GLS (functional & SDF)
- 🧪 Caravel hardening
- 🔁 RTL → GDS → GLS → MPW
- 💥 Failure cases and irreversible mistakes
- ♻️ Disaster recovery via WSL export/import

Nothing here is theoretical.  
Every file exists because **something failed before**.

- Do not update. **Clone**.
- Do not rebuild. **Export & import**.
- Your environment is an **asset**, not a workspace.

If you violate these rules, failure is expected.
