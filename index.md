# OpenLane Guide — Repository Index

This repository **must be read in order**.  
It is intentionally strict.

If you jump around, you will recreate the same failures this guide exists to prevent.

---

## Phase 1 — Environment Survival (Mandatory)

01. [01_WSL_Docker_Setup.md](./01_WSL_Docker_Setup.md)  
WSL2 + Docker Desktop configured for stability and export/import survivability.

02. [02_OpenLane1_Setup.md](./02_OpenLane1_Setup.md)  
Install and **freeze** OpenLane1 (Makefile-based). This is the **production** flow.

03. [03_OpenLane2_Setup.md](./03_OpenLane2_Setup.md)  
Install OpenLane2 for **evaluation only**. Strict isolation. **Never mix with OpenLane1.**

04. [04_PDK_Setup.md](./04_PDK_Setup.md)  
PDK is the asset. Pin the version. Keep it in one place. **Build once. Never rebuild casually.**

05. [05_Verification_Test.md](./05_Verification_Test.md)  
Smoke tests proving the environment, PDK, and toolchain are correct.

06. [06_Migration_WSL_Export.md](./06_Migration_WSL_Export.md)  
Disaster recovery via WSL export/import. Hardware failure becomes irrelevant.

07. [07_Troubleshooting.md](./07_Troubleshooting.md)  
Failure prevention checklist. This is **not** a fix-it guide.

## Phase 2 — Physical Design Reality

08. [08_Placement.md](./08_Placement.md)  
Placement fundamentals: density, legalization, convergence.

09. [09_CTS.md](./09_CTS.md)  
Clock Tree Synthesis: skew, insertion delay, and downstream impact.

10. [10_Routing.md](./10_Routing.md)  
Global and detailed routing: congestion, DRC pressure, failure points.

11. [11_STA.md](./11_STA.md)  
Static Timing Analysis: WNS/TNS, setup/hold, uncertainty, interpretation.

12. [12_GLS.md](./12_GLS.md)  
Gate-level simulation without SDF: what it proves and what it hides.

13. [13_SDF_GLS.md](./13_SDF_GLS.md)  
SDF-annotated GLS: timing becomes behavior.

## Phase 3 — Integration and Timing Truth

14. [14_OpenROAD_STA.md](./14_OpenROAD_STA.md)  
Using OpenROAD and STA together without dead ends.

15. [15_Routing_and_Congestion.md](./15_Routing_and_Congestion.md)  
Congestion analysis and routing strategy.

16. [16_GLS_and_SDF.md](./16_GLS_and_SDF.md)  
RTL vs GLS vs SDF-GLS: what “matches” actually means.

17. [17_Magic_KLayout_Reality_Check.md](./17_Magic_KLayout_Reality_Check.md)  
What layout viewers show—and what they never will.

18. [18_STA_Reality_and_Timing_Closure.md](./18_STA_Reality_and_Timing_Closure.md)  
Timing closure mindset and rollback discipline.

19. [19_GLS_SDF_Timing.md](./19_GLS_SDF_Timing.md)  
Timing failure signatures visible only in waveforms.

20. [20_Environment_Failure_Model.md](./20_Environment_Failure_Model.md)  
Why OpenLane environments collapse in practice.

21. [21_Final_Rules_of_Survival.md](./21_Final_Rules_of_Survival.md)  
Non-negotiable rules for long-term survival.

## Final Warning

This repository is not friendly.  
It is not flexible.  
It is reliable.

If you want novelty, leave.  
If you want OpenLane to stop breaking, stay.
